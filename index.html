      <h2>Story on Confinement</h2>
      <p>Refer to the painting I believe that the painter wants to show the saddened life of the boy. The loneliness in his life. It seems the boy is a juggler who goes everyday out to make people happy by his tricks. He laughs and plays in front of people and try to make them happy and create a fake smile on his face in front of the people. But deep down he has no one in life. He is unhappy and sorrowful. Lonely boy who comes after the long tiring day has no one to ask him a glass of water. He has on one to love him or to care about him. He is doing this job to kill his remaining time. Now he is present there just lying on the floor saddened and is tired of being fake in front of the whole audience the whole day. The boy is so poor that he has no memories of good moments so that he could recall them and bring a little smile on his face but he had never been with someone in his life for this long to make memorable moments. He had been tough too much in his life that he can’t even cry now. The tears of his eyes have been dried and he can just mourn on his loneliness. He is looking at the poor cat he has only one besides him in this moment of sadness. And the poor cat who has nowhere to go is sitting, might be thinking and saddened at this poor boy’s life. Somehow the cat may know the loneliness of this guy and not leaving him and caring for him by being with him unlike the thousands of people who laugh by watching his show but can’t see the sadness and depression in his eyes. The poor boy looking at the cat so helpless and thinking that he can’t do anything about it. To describe that how saddened he is and he has a lot to say but has no one to talk to. The story tells the grief of having no one who cares about you and being confined in a place or the monotonous routine can break a man so deeply. No matter how much strong you are and how much you try to be happy in front of people but there is a time comes in your life where u just get tired of wearing the fake mask of happiness on your face and you just break at some point.
I would end the story with this quote: <b><em>“we’re all of us sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins, for life”. –Tennessee Williams.</em> </b>

<h2>Arguments and Justification of Ideas</h2>
<p>After reading this paragraph on confinement I came to two ends of it. I agree and also disagree with this.  Both have its own reasons. As the Blaise pascal has jotted down his own thoughts that being confined in one’s room can give one a lot of benefits like it gives us the opportunity to think of what we actually are or what we want, or maybe we can recall some old beautiful memories or any gratifying moments which we spent with anyone in our life.  That is fairly fine, I agree with these statements I mean sometimes it is good to be detached from the outer world and think about what we are doing in our lives. Is it actually worth full or not? Maybe we should think that we shouldn’t be judging others and discover ourselves. Are what we doing is actually right or wrong? And it gives us a chance to think that we should stop being fake in front of people and start being ourselves, because that is the righteous thing to do. I also agree with his idea that the least you can do in confinement to travel back in places you were present with your loved ones in your life and that enjoyment you had. Or maybe yes we should be happy and thankful for the things we actually have and know the worth of them and accept our fate. In short it is a big opportunity to think what we had done and what we can do to make it better and should be cherish able for the things we have. The best time where we can ask questions to ourselves and also find the answers of them by ourselves. But here’s the second end of the picture in my point of view. I also disagree with this thought of the philosopher on confinement that ‘The sole cause of man’s unhappiness is that he cannot stay quietly in his room.’ Maybe there is a man who’ve never been out. Who’ve never enjoyed in his life. What if he is confined since his childhood? What if he is inhibited in four walls and not allowed to explore the whole planet or maybe not even his neighborhood? It could happen to someone somehow purposely or not. Maybe someone is ill or disabled or maybe being tortured somewhere. How will he recall his memories if he doesn’t have any? Then yes it could be the beginning of psychological torture in someone. Both the facts can be true or somehow maybe they are true. Maybe someone has to stop being quiet in his room and start speaking for his rights. Because no one can be treated like a puppet and can be confined in a place for his whole life. He has his own rights to live.</p>
